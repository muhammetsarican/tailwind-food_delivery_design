# Tailwind Css - Food Delivery Design

I coded a design that created by [Muhsin Deniz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhsindeniz/) at **Frontend Central** server at discord. The design name is Food Delivery. It was created at [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and designed for restaurants or etc. It has responsive design and three pages. When I was developing this project I had so fun and I learned so much things ðŸ¥³.
